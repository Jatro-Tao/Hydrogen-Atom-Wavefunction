# Hydrogen-Atom-Wavefunction
A MATLAB function to:  
- Calculate hydrogen(-like) atom Wavefunction $\phi_{nlm}$ and print it in LaTex  
- Plot radial part of wavefunction $R_{nl}(r)$ and radial distribution function $r^2{R_{nl}(r)}^2$  
- Show 3-dimension image of spherical harmonics $Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$ 
- Show 3-dimension image of hydrogen atom wavefunction
